# Feature Engineering


* Handling Missing Values
    * Removing rows or columns that have the missing data
    * Imputing missing values using proxies like mean, median, or mode
    * Using algorithms that can handle these missing values, e.g., random forest

* Handling Outliers
    * Visual approach – Creating box plots and scatter plots so you can see the outlier
    * Statistical approach –  Using z-score or IQR methods to find these outliers statistically

* Handling Data Inconsistency
    * Standardizing the data to maintain consistency in terms of format unit and scales
    * Automating the work by implementing data validation checks, aka unit tests software developers use for testing features.

* Handling Datatype Issues
    * Inspect, cast, and convert your data types
    * Automate by implementing checks to validate data types at various stages of your project.

* Handling Duplicate Data
    * Group it so that it’ll deduplicate automatically
    * Add checks at every stage of your analysis to prevent unwanted duplicates
